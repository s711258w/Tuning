    <H1>Bio</H1>
    <div class = "plain-container">
    <p>I was born and raised in Seattle.  After college, I moved to Chicago to find a job as a chemist.  During my two plus years there, I spent much of my spare time practicing the piano.  I thought I might enjoy piano technology as a career. 
    Being self employed, returning to the west coast, and doing something artistic and tangible that people could directly benefit from, all appealed to me.  After completing a nine month course in piano tuning and repair, I was ready to take the plunge.  
    I left my job, moved to Seattle, and began my new career. Next to marrying my wife of 33 years, it was probably the best decision I've ever made.</p>
